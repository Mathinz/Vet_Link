    <string name="error_show_more">Please Dont Pat Me Australia can also offer owner trainers advocacy assistance when dealing with access challenges. Handlers who are with an assistance dog organisation should approach their organisation for support in the first instance. The volunteers at Please Dont Pat Me Australia are experienced with dealing with access challenges and are usually able to resolve them with education. When education fails a Please Dont Pat Me Australia volunteer disability discrimination advocate will help you with the process of lodging a disability discrimination complaint with the relevant authorities. If you have experienced discrimination because you use an assistance dog please fill out the form below. This service is only available to handlers located in Australia.
